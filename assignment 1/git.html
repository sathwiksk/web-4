<h1>VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects and enable them to collaborate on those projects. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.</li>

    <li>  There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).</li>

    <li>  Developers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.</li>

    </ul>
<h1>GITHUB INTRODUCTION</h1>
<ol>
      <li>The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008</li>
      <li>First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.</li>
      <li>Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects).</li>
</ol>
<h2>GIT Commands</h2>
<dl>
      <dt>1.GIT INIT</dt>
      <dd>This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
      <dt>2.GIT COMMIT</dt>
      <dd>Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID. Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
      <dt>3.GIT MERGE</dt>
      <dd>Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch. For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
        <dt>4.GIT FORK</dt>
        <dd>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</dd>
